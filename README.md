# GraphQl JSON Server

## About

This project serves as a graphql server for developers who want to showcase their projects on their websites/portfolios.
The Schema can be modified for individual needs as well as the graphql root queries and mutations. 

## Usage

Start the graphql-json server with the command: `npm run server`
  
If you would just like to start the JSON server to view your data locally, use: `npm run json:server`  
If you would just like to start the graphql server to query and mutate your data use: `npm run dev:server`
  
You can run graphql queries and mutations at `localhost:4000/graphql`  
  
You can view the actual data you have in the `data.json` file in your project or at `localhost:3000/projects`  
  
Make sure you don't store anything too sensitive yet, as this server is **not** authenticated

Feel free to clone the repo! :)
